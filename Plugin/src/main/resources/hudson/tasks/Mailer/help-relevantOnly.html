  If this option is checked, all emails will only be sent to the listed relevant developers.
  <p>
  This feature can come in handy if a project has a lot of interested parties, but
  is going through a code sprint where lots of changes are being made daily.  Management
  and team leads may not need to have their inboxes cluttered with messages, but they
  may come in handy for the currently working developers.
